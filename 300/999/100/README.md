# 100 - Getting Started

Based on "[SpaceTimeDB - Getting Started](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/getting-started)" 

To develop SpacetimeDB databases locally, you will need to run the Standalone version of the server.

- [Install](https://spacetimedb.com/install) the SpacetimeDB CLI (Command Line Interface)
- Run the start command:

   ```bash
   $ spacetime start
   ```

The server listens on port **3000** by default, customized via **--listen-addr**.
